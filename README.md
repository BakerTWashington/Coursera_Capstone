# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone project for IBM Data Science Certification. The project entailed using the Foursquare Places API, and I used this API to determine ideal locations for venues in Lexington, KY, based on visits from the Keeneland Race Course in Lexington. The markdown is given in IBM_Capstone.ipynb. The final report is given in IBM_Capstone.pdf, and presentation slides for the project are provided in IMB_Presentation.pdf.
